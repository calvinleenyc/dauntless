The images here show the hallucinations on test_seen data.

There are two groups of images: the ones which are titled "Screenshot from [datetime]" are screenshots of Tensorboard were taken at a much later stage of training than all the rest.  (~24 hours of training vs ~6 hours.)

An especially noteworthy example is glove_moves.png, which is a successful hallucination of a glove being pushed around by the robot arm.  (As remarked in the original paper, the frames get blurrier as time goes on.)
